This directory will hold any additional Python packages installed into
this Zope instance.  Installing Distutils-based packages should be
done using the command:

  /usr/local/python-2.4.5/bin/python setup.py install --home /usr/local/zope-2.9.11/zope-comm

This will cause the newly installed Python packages to appear in this
directory.
